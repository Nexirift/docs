# Staff Member Security

At Nexirift, we prioritize security as a cornerstone of our operations. This comprehensive policy outlines the mandatory guidelines and industry best practices for all staff to follow, ensuring the protection of our assets, data integrity, and organizational reputation.

## Passwords

These guidelines apply to both traditional passwords and passphrase authentication methods. Additional specifications may be implemented to address unique requirements for each approach.

### Complexity

All staff members must create and maintain strong authentication credentials:

**For traditional passwords:**

- Passwords must be a minimum of 12 characters in length.
- Passwords must include at least one lowercase letter, one uppercase letter, one number, and one special character.
- Passwords must not be reused across different services or be easily guessable.

**For passphrases:**

- Passphrases must contain at least 4 distinct words.
- Passphrases must implement a symbol as a separator between words.
- Passphrases must not be reused across services or consist of commonly known phrases.

### Management

- The use of approved password managers is mandatory for storing and managing all credentials.
   - Google Password Manager and LastPass are explicitly prohibited due to documented security vulnerabilities.
   - All employees must utilize the company-designated password management solution.
   - Bitwarden is the officially approved password manager for all Nexirift employees.
- Under no circumstances should passwords be stored in plaintext, written down in unsecured locations, or shared with other individuals.

## Two-Factor Authentication

Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) is mandatory without exception for all staff members. Any service or application that utilizes a Nexirift account or email address must have 2FA enabled wherever the functionality exists. Passkey technology is strongly recommended to further enhance account security through its hardware-based authentication mechanisms.

## Security Incidents

All staff members are required to immediately report any suspected or confirmed security incidents to the security team through the designated reporting channels. The security team will lead the investigation and implement appropriate mitigation measures. Staff must fully cooperate with the security team throughout the investigation and remediation process, providing any requested information without delay.

## Software and System Security

- All software, applications, and systems must be kept current with the latest security patches and updates.
- Staff members must strictly limit their access to only those systems and applications for which they have explicit authorization.
- Exercise vigilance regarding suspicious emails, links, attachments, and never download files or software from untrusted or unverified sources.

## Physical Security

- All systems containing confidential or sensitive data must be physically secured and locked when unattended, even for brief periods.
- Sensitive information and documents must be stored in designated secure environments with appropriate access controls in place.
- Clean desk policy must be followed, ensuring no sensitive materials are left visible after working hours.

## Compliance

Non-compliance with this security policy constitutes a serious violation and may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment, depending on the severity and frequency of the infraction.
