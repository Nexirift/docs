# Staff Integrity

The integrity, safety, and well‑being of our community members are central to our mission. We are committed to an environment of mutual respect, psychological safety, inclusion, and professionalism in which all participants can thrive.

## Policy Update

We are instituting an internal Staff Integrity Policy to reinforce these values. A staff member who demonstrates a documented pattern of interpersonal conflict, boundary violations, harassment, retaliatory behavior, misuse of access, or other unprofessional conduct toward community members may face corrective action up to and including temporary suspension or permanent removal from their role. The response will be proportionate to the severity, impact, intent, and frequency of the behavior.

## Scope and Definitions

For clarity:
- Staff includes moderators, administrators, contractors, and any individual entrusted with elevated permissions or privileged data.
- Inappropriate conduct includes (but is not limited to) harassment, intimidation, discrimination, retaliation, misuse of moderation or platform tools, disclosure of confidential or private information, and conflicts of interest left unmanaged.
- Documented pattern means two or more substantiated incidents, or one egregious incident that independently warrants escalation.

## Purpose and Goals

This policy framework aims to:
- Maintain a positive, professional, and inclusive environment
- Uphold high standards of ethical and accountable conduct
- Safeguard confidential and sensitive user information
- Ensure fair, consistent, and unbiased use of moderation privileges
- Reinforce trust between staff and the broader community
- Provide a transparent, structured process for addressing concerns

## Process Overview

1. Reporting: Concerns may be reported through designated internal channels or (where available) confidential reporting forms. Anonymous reports are reviewed if sufficient detail exists.
2. Preliminary Review: A neutral reviewer (or small panel) conducts an initial fact-finding to determine if the concern merits formal investigation.
3. Investigation: Relevant evidence (logs, communications, access records) is gathered. Parties may provide statements. Confidentiality is maintained to the extent possible.
4. Determination: Findings are documented. Leadership assesses severity, impact, and any mitigating or aggravating factors.
5. Corrective Action: Possible actions include coaching, written warning, temporary limitation or suspension of privileges, reassignment, or removal from role.
6. Appeal: Where appropriate, the staff member may submit one appeal citing procedural errors or new material evidence within a defined timeframe.
7. Recordkeeping: Outcomes are recorded securely for accountability and pattern detection, with access restricted to authorized leadership.

## Safeguards and Principles

- Proportionality: Actions match the seriousness of the conduct.
- Consistency: Similar cases are handled with comparable standards.
- Confidentiality: Sensitive information is shared strictly on a need-to-know basis.
- Non-Retaliation: Retaliation against reporters or witnesses is itself a violation.
- Least Intrusive Means: Interventions start with the least restrictive effective measure, escalating only as needed.
- Duty to Disclose Conflicts: Staff must proactively disclose potential conflicts of interest.

## Scenario Example

Scenario: A staff member enters a heated, public dispute with a user on an external social platform. That same user is active within our community, where the staff member wields moderation authority.

Key risks:
- Perceived or actual retaliatory moderation (e.g., unfair sanctions, selective enforcement)
- Improper querying, access to, or disclosure of the user’s private or internal data
- Creation of an intimidating, biased, or exclusionary environment for the user and bystanders
- Undermining community trust in the impartiality of staff

Application of policy:
- The incident is reported and logged.
- A preliminary review confirms a potential conflict of interest and conduct concern.
- Access logs are checked for unusual queries on the user’s data.
- Interim safeguards (e.g., temporary restriction from actions affecting that user) may be applied.
- Findings determine whether coaching, formal warning, or removal is warranted.

## Authority and Enforcement

This policy authorizes senior leadership (or their delegate panel) to enact timely and proportionate corrective measures, including temporary or permanent adjustment of responsibilities or access, to preserve community integrity and professional standards.

## Continuous Improvement

This framework will be reviewed periodically to incorporate community feedback, evolving best practices, and lessons learned from prior cases, ensuring it remains fair, effective, and transparent.
