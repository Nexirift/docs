# Flags

<BadgeWrapper selected="Instance Variation" />

Flags are an internal mechanism used by Nexirift to mark and categorize content across the platform (for more comprehensive information, see [Vortex](vortex)). These system indicators help identify various content attributes in the backend, such as detecting automated accounts or potentially harmful content.

## Implementation of Flags

Nexirift implements flags at two primary levels:
1. **Account level** - Applied to user accounts
2. **Content level** - Applied to individual posts and messages

> **Important note:** Some flags serve purely as internal identifiers and may not directly affect account functionality or visibility.

## Flag Categories

### FLAG_DANGER

**Applies to:** Accounts

Identifies accounts exhibiting potentially dangerous behavior. This flag is activated when Nexirift's systems detect indications that an account may pose immediate harm to themselves or others. This triggers appropriate safety protocols and review procedures.

### FLAG_SPAM

**Applies to:** Accounts & Posts

Identifies spam-related activity across the platform. This flag is applied when:
- Users repeatedly share unsolicited links in posts
- Users post excessive identical or similar content
- Accounts engage in mass messaging with promotional content
- Posts contain patterns consistent with automated spam distribution

### FLAG_COMPROMISED

**Applies to:** Accounts

Identifies accounts showing signs of unauthorized access or security breach. When suspicious activity patterns are detected within a defined timeframe (such as unusual login locations, behavior changes, or credential modifications), this flag triggers temporary account deactivation to protect user data while the situation is resolved.

### FLAG_MANIPULATION

**Applies to:** Accounts & Posts

Identifies content manipulation attempts on the platform. This flag is applied to accounts or specific posts that:
- Spread verifiably false information
- Attempt to mislead the community
- Engage in coordinated inauthentic behavior
- Present fabricated content as factual
