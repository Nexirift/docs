# Cybersecurity Incident Response

Nexirift maintains a structured, time‑bound incident response program to rapidly detect, investigate, contain, eradicate, and learn from security events affecting our systems, data, or third‑party integrations. The program emphasizes transparency, evidence preservation, stakeholder communication, and continuous improvement to minimize impact and prevent recurrence.

## Categories of Security Incidents

1. **Unauthorized Access:** Any unapproved use of or attempt to access Nexirift systems, internal services, customer data repositories, proprietary information, or integrated third-party platforms.
2. **Data Breach:** Unauthorized acquisition, exfiltration, alteration, destruction, or exposure of user or company data, including PII, credentials, keys, or sensitive configuration data.
3. **Malware Infection:** Presence or execution of malicious code (e.g., viruses, trojans, ransomware, spyware, rootkits) in production, development, or networked environments.
4. **Social Engineering:** Phishing, vishing, pretexting, baiting, or similar manipulation targeting personnel to gain access or information.
5. **Denial of Service:** Attacks or failures that degrade or render unavailable Nexirift services, APIs, applications, or critical business systems.
6. **Insider Threat:** Malicious or negligent misuse of authorized access (data theft, sabotage, policy violations) by current or former employees, contractors, or other trusted parties.

## Incident Reporting Procedures

**For the public:**

- Report suspected vulnerabilities or security incidents to [security@nexirift.com](mailto:security@nexirift.com). We prioritize confidentiality and timely review.
- Please include (when possible): description, affected asset or URL, reproduction steps, timestamps (with timezone), impact estimate, and any supporting evidence (e.g., headers, logs, screenshots).

**For Nexirift employees:**

- Immediately escalate suspected incidents to your team leader and the security team via approved emergency channels (designated chat / hotline / ticket). Do not attempt ad‑hoc remediation that could destroy evidence.
- Provide: who discovered it, when, systems involved, observed indicators, actions already taken (if any), and urgency concerns.

## Response Framework

1. **Initial Assessment & Triage:** The security team reviews the report, validates the event, assigns a severity level (based on impact, scope, exploitation likelihood, and data sensitivity), and initiates the incident record. Target: begin analysis within 30 minutes of receipt for high/critical reports.
2. **Containment Strategy:** Actions focus on limiting spread and preserving evidence, which may include:
   - Disabling or locking suspected accounts and rotating credentials/keys.
   - Revoking active sessions and invalidating tokens or API keys.
   - Network isolation, segmentation, or controlled shutdown of affected components.
   - Capturing forensically sound disk / memory / log snapshots.
   - Deploying temporary compensating controls (e.g., stricter firewall rules, feature flags).
   - Executing emergency shutdowns when necessary to prevent escalated compromise.
3. **Notification Protocol:** Communications follow a tiered, least‑delay model:
   - Immediate escalation to security leadership and executive stakeholders.
   - Internal status postings in designated incident channels.
   - External statement via the official @Security account (as appropriate).
   - Direct notices to affected customers within statutory/regulatory timeframes.
   - Law enforcement or regulatory engagement where legally or strategically appropriate.
4. **Recovery Operations:** Restore integrity and normal operations while reducing residual risk:
   - Root cause validation and forensic evidence analysis.
   - System rebuilds or restorations from known-good, verified backups.
   - Patch and configuration hardening; removal of malicious artifacts.
   - Credential, token, and secret rotation as needed.
   - Validation testing (security + functional) prior to full production reintegration.
5. **Ongoing Communication:** Maintain clear, consistent updates:
   - Scheduled status intervals (e.g., hourly for critical, then taper as stabilized).
   - Disclosure of known impact, mitigations in place, and next milestones.
   - Action guidance for affected users (password resets, client updates, etc.).
   - Revision of timelines if new findings adjust scope or complexity.
6. **Post-Incident Analysis:** After containment and recovery:
   - Assemble a detailed timeline (detection, escalation, decisions, actions, closure).
   - Identify root cause(s), control gaps, and contributing factors (technical & procedural).
   - Quantify impact (systems, data classes, duration, user segments).
   - Produce a remediation and prevention plan with owners and target dates.
   - Deliver a formal report to leadership; share sanitized lessons internally.
7. **Continuous Improvement & Compliance:** Nexirift commits to:
   - Tracking and completing all corrective actions (with verification).
   - Updating runbooks, playbooks, and detection logic.
   - Conducting focused training or awareness refreshers based on observed gaps.
   - Ensuring adherence to applicable laws, regulations, and industry standards.
   - Performing periodic tabletop exercises and live simulations to test readiness.
   - Measuring and reviewing key metrics (MTTD, MTTR, containment time, recurrence rate).
