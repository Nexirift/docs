# Non-Consensual Content

Nexirift is committed to protecting user safety, dignity, and privacy. We act swiftly to remove or restrict non-consensual content and handle every report with urgency, confidentiality, and compassion.

## What Is Non-Consensual Content?

Non-consensual content is any material shared, created, or distributed without the clear, voluntary permission of every identifiable person involved. It includes (not exhaustive):

- Intimate or sexual images, video, or audio involving individuals who did not consent to capture or distribution
- Content originally shared consensually but later re-shared without permission (often called "revenge porn")
- Recordings (audio, video, screen captures) of private conversations or calls without required consent
  - Especially in jurisdictions requiring all-party consent
- Hidden camera, upskirting, voyeuristic, or surreptitious recordings
- Images, audio, or video manipulated or generated (e.g., deepfakes, AI composites) to depict a person in scenarios they did not authorize
- Sextortion, blackmail, or coercive threats involving private material
- Personal data or identifying details (doxxing) shared to harass, extort, or intimidate
- Attempts to solicit, trade, or index non-consensual intimate material

If you are unsure whether something qualifies, report it—our Safety Team will review.

## Immediate Safety

If you or someone else is in immediate physical danger, contact your local emergency services before submitting a report to us.

## How to Report Non-Consensual Content

We offer a dedicated, confidential reporting channel. You may report on behalf of yourself, a minor, or another affected individual if you have reason to believe consent was not granted.

### If the Content Involves a Minor (Under 18)

Act immediately:

1. Contact authorities first (possession, distribution, or viewing may be illegal). Submit a report to the relevant body:
   - [Australian Centre to Counter Child Exploitation (ACCCE)](https://www.accce.gov.au/help-and-support/how-and-what-to-report) (Australia)
   - [Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)](https://www.fbi.gov/how-we-can-help-you/parents-and-caregivers-protecting-your-kids) (United States)
   - [National Center for Missing & Exploited Children (NCMEC)](https://www.missingkids.org/gethelpnow/cybertipline) (United States)
   - [Internet Watch Foundation](https://report.iwf.org.uk/en) (UK)
   - [Cybertip.ca](https://www.cybertip.ca/) (Canada)
   - [Better Internet for Kids / Safer Internet Centres](https://www.betterinternetforkids.eu/sic) (EU)

2. Report to Nexirift: Use our official reporting system. Provide any law enforcement case or reference numbers.

3. Preserve evidence: Do not forward or share the material further. Do not delete messages, URLs, or logs that can help identify source, uploader, or distribution path.

We will:
- Remove or block the reported content immediately upon validation
- Preserve relevant data for lawful investigation
- Suspend implicated accounts pending review
- Provide a unique reference number you can share with authorities
- Assign a dedicated case manager to coordinate with law enforcement

Response targets (minors): Acknowledge within 1 hour; initial enforcement action within 4 hours (often much faster). Our specialized response team operates 24/7.

### If the Content Involves an Adult

For non-consensual adult content (including sexual assault imagery, intimate image abuse, sextortion, blackmail, coerced sharing, or unauthorized distribution):

1. Consider contacting authorities (recommended if there is sextortion, assault, ongoing threats, trafficking indicators, or blackmail):
   - Sextortion / online blackmail: [FBI Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3)](https://www.ic3.gov/) (US) or your national cybercrime reporting body
   - Sexual assault: Local police or a sexual assault crisis center
   - Cyber harassment / stalking: Local law enforcement or cybercrime unit

2. Report to Nexirift promptly: Submit a detailed report (links, usernames, timestamps, context, any prior consent withdrawal).

3. Preserve evidence: Save originals (screenshots, URLs with timestamps, message headers). Avoid altering metadata. Do not engage with extortion demands.

4. Access support resources (optional but encouraged):
   - [National Sexual Assault Hotline (RAINN)](https://www.rainn.org/): 1-800-656-HOPE (4673) (US)
   - [Cyber Civil Rights Initiative](https://www.cybercivilrights.org/): Advocacy and removal guidance
   - [National Domestic Violence Hotline](https://www.thehotline.org/): 1-800-799-SAFE (7233) (US)
   - Local victim services, legal aid, or digital rights organizations (availability varies by region)

We will:
- Remove or restrict the identified content upon confirmation
- Preserve relevant data for lawful requests
- Apply a high-severity violation to implicated accounts pending investigation
- Provide a unique reference number
- Assign a case manager to guide you and coordinate with authorities (if involved)

Response targets (adults): Acknowledge within 1 hour; initial enforcement action within 4 hours. Available 24/7.

## What to Include in Your Report (Optional but Helpful)

- Direct links / URLs (not just screenshots)
- Uploader usernames or profile IDs
- Approximate upload or first-seen date/time (and time zone)
- A brief description of why content is non-consensual (e.g., "shared after consent revoked" / "deepfake" / "hidden recording")
- Any law enforcement case number (if reported)
- Confirmation if you are the person depicted or reporting on behalf of someone else

Do not endanger yourself attempting to gather more evidence.

## Our Review Principles

- Safety first: We err on the side of removal where credible indicators of non-consent exist.
- Minimal resurfacing: We limit internal exposure to harmful material during review.
- Confidentiality: We share information only with authorized law enforcement or as required by applicable law.
- Non-retaliation: Reporting will not negatively affect your account standing in good faith situations.
- Appeals: If content was removed in error, affected parties may request a re-evaluation (never for confirmed minor sexual content).

## After Action

You will receive:
- Confirmation of receipt
- Reference number
- Notification of initial action (removed / restricted / escalated)
- Instructions for any next steps or law enforcement follow-up

If you do not receive acknowledgment within the stated timeframe, re-submit or contact support referencing any previous ticket number.

## Important Notes

- Do not attempt to negotiate with extortionists. Report immediately.
- Sharing or downloading suspected child sexual abuse material (CSAM) is illegal; capture only necessary metadata (URL, time) and report.
- Deepfake / synthetic abuse is treated as seriously as conventional recordings if a real person is depicted or reasonably identifiable.

Your report helps protect the broader community. Thank you for acting.

If you need clarification before submitting, you can still file a report—our team will guide you on next steps.

We are here 24/7.
