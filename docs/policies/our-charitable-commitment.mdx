# Our Charitable Commitment

In the event that Nexirift achieves sustainable profits exceeding $10,000 USD annually (this threshold may be adjusted based on evolving equipment costs and operational expenses), Nexirift commits to donating all excess profits to verified charitable organizations. We will publish an annual transparency report detailing all charitable contributions and their impact.
