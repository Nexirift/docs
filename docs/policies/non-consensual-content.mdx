# Non-Consensual Content

Nexirift prioritizes the privacy and safety of our users. We take swift, decisive action on all requests to remove or restrict non-consensual content from our platform, treating each case with the urgency and sensitivity it deserves.

## What is Non-Consensual Content?

Non-consensual content encompasses any materials shared without explicit permission from all parties involved. This includes but is not limited to:

- Intimate or sexual content involving individuals who have not consented to be photographed, filmed, or have their images distributed
- Recordings of private conversations where participants have not provided consent to be recorded
    - This applies particularly in jurisdictions where laws explicitly prohibit recording conversations without all parties' consent
- Personal information or data shared without authorization
- Images or videos that have been manipulated (including deepfakes) to include a person without their permission

## How to Report Non-Consensual Content

### If the content involves an adult
