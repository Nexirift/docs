# Our Charitable Commitment

Nexirift is committed to directing a meaningful share of future profits to verified charitable organizations once we reach sustained, responsible profitability. We view technology as a catalyst for broad social good—not an end in itself. To uphold this principle, we will release an annual transparency report detailing:
- Total funds donated
- Allocation by organization and program focus
- Rationale for selection
- Measurable impact metrics (where available)
- Administrative overhead (if any)

We prioritize organizations that align with our values of privacy, security, open access, and human well‑being.
