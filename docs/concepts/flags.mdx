# Flags

<BadgeWrapper selected="Instance Variation" />

Flags are a way to mark content on Nexirift. They are used in the backend of the platform to identify various content attributes, such as whether an account is determined to be a bot or not.

Some flags are externally exposed, such as the `FLAG_NSFW` flag, which is used to mark posts as NSFW. However, flags have the ability to be locked meaning that the post author cannot remove the flag.

## Our use of flags

General flags are used to identify accounts _and_ posts on the platform.

:warning: Some flags are only used to identify accounts and may not have any impact on the accounts themselves. :warning:

### FLAG_DANGER

**Applies to:** Accounts

This flag is used to identify accounts that are potentially dangerous. More specifically, this flag will be added when Nexirift deems that an account may cause immediate harm to themselves or others around them.

### FLAG_SPAM

**Applies to:** Accounts & Posts

This flag is used to identify accounts that are potentially spam. More specifically, if a user is spamming links on posts (incl. replies to other posts) or spamming messages/links in chats, this flag will be added.

### FLAG_COMPROMISED

**Applies to:** Accounts

This flag is used to identify accounts that are potentially compromised. More specifically, if an account has had suspicious activity within a certain timeframe, this flag will be added and the account will be disabled temporarily.

### FLAG_MANIPULATION

**Applies to:** Accounts & Posts

This flag is used to identify accounts that have been deemed to be manipulating the platform. More specifically, if an account has been posting misinformation or spreading false information, this flag will be added.

### FLAG_NSFW

**Applies to:** Accounts & Posts

This flag is used to identify posts that are marked as NSFW (Not Safe For Work). This flag can be added to posts by the post's author, however, moderators can also add this flag to posts in a "locked" state.
