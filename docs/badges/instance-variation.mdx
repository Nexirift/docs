# Instance Variation

This badge is used to indicate that a feature may vary between instances of Nexirift.

<BadgeWrapper selected="Instance Variation" link={false} as="span" />

## Why?

This badge is a little similar to the [Specific to Nexirift](/badges/specific-to-nexirift) badge. However, this badge is used to indicate that a feature may be absent from a specific instance of Nexirift, but is present in other instances.

For example, an instance of Nexirift may have the [Verification](/features/verification) feature disabled or certain sub-features of that, such as the business verified checkmark.

Please remember that our goal is to make Nexirift highly customizable and that means that nearly every feature can be toggled on and off but will not have this badge. This badge is specifically used to mark sub-features, not features themselves.
