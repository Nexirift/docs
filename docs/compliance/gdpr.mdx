# GDPR

The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a comprehensive European Union regulation that establishes strict guidelines for how personal data must be collected, processed, stored, and protected.

## Our Policy

<BadgeWrapper selected="Instance Variation" />

**The following requirements serve as a baseline for GDPR compliance across all Nexirift instances. We strongly recommend consulting with legal professionals for specific guidance relevant to your implementation.**

In accordance with GDPR principles, we've established these essential requirements that all Nexirift instances should implement:

- Implement robust security measures for collecting and storing personal data, with end-to-end encryption as the recommended standard.
- Ensure complete data subject rights by providing users with straightforward mechanisms to:
  - Access their personal data
  - Request a complete export of their information
  - Update or rectify inaccurate personal data
  - Exercise their right to be forgotten through account deletion

Please note that GDPR compliance varies between different Nexirift instances. While the official Nexirift platform maintains full GDPR compliance, third-party instances may implement different standards. Users should review the specific privacy policies of each instance they interact with.
