# Cybersecurity Incident Response

As part of our unwavering commitment to transparency and accountability, Nexirift maintains a robust incident response protocol when addressing any security incidents or breaches. This comprehensive framework covers incidents related to user data, system security vulnerabilities, and those involving third-party service providers. Our structured approach ensures immediate identification, thorough investigation, and effective remediation of all security events to minimize impact and prevent recurrence.

## Categories of Security Incidents

1. **Unauthorized Access:** Any unauthorized access or attempts to breach Nexirift systems, including internal staff services, customer data repositories, proprietary information, or connected third-party services.
2. **Data Breach:** The unauthorized acquisition, exfiltration, or exposure of user data, including personally identifiable information (PII), non-public personal information, authentication credentials, or security-related infrastructure data.
3. **Malware Infection:** Detection of malicious software, including but not limited to viruses, trojans, ransomware, spyware, rootkits, or other harmful code on any Nexirift production systems, development environments, or networked infrastructure.
4. **Social Engineering Attacks:** Incidents involving manipulation techniques such as phishing, vishing, pretexting, baiting, or other deceptive practices targeting Nexirift personnel with the intent to gain unauthorized access or information.
5. **Denial of Service:** Any attacks or technical failures resulting in degradation or complete unavailability of Nexirift's services, applications, APIs, or critical business systems that impact customer experience or operational capabilities.
6. **Insider Threat:** Incidents involving misuse of authorized access, data theft, sabotage, or other malicious activities perpetrated by current or former employees, contractors, or other parties with legitimate access to Nexirift systems or information.

## Incident Reporting Procedures

**For the public:**

- If you discover or suspect a security incident, please immediately report it to Nexirift's dedicated security team via email at [security@nexirift.com](mailto:security@nexirift.com). Your report will be treated with the highest priority and confidentiality.

**For Nexirift employees:**

- If you identify or suspect a security incident, report it immediately to both your team leader and the security team through the designated emergency response channels. Time is critical in security incident containment.

## Response Framework

1. **Initial Assessment & Triage:** Upon receiving a security incident report, the security team will immediately conduct a comprehensive analysis to determine the scope, severity, impact, and potential risks associated with the incident. This assessment will be completed within our guaranteed 30-minute response window.

2. **Containment Strategy:** The security team will execute decisive actions to contain the incident and prevent further damage. These measures may include:
   - Immediately locking down and/or disabling all potentially compromised staff accounts.
   - Revoking active sessions, invalidating API keys, and enforcing password changes across affected systems.
   - Isolating the affected systems from the network through segmentation or complete disconnection.
   - Creating forensically sound snapshots of affected systems and data for thorough analysis and evidence preservation.
   - Implementing additional security controls to prevent lateral movement within the network.
   - When necessary, implementing critical system shutdowns even if they temporarily impact end-user services to prevent catastrophic damage.

3. **Notification Protocol:** All affected parties will be notified according to our tiered communication plan:
   - Immediate notification to executive leadership
   - Official statement via the @Security account on Nexirift
   - Direct communication with affected customers within legally required timeframes
   - Coordination with law enforcement agencies when appropriate for further investigation and evidence collection

4. **Recovery Operations:** The security team will implement our established recovery procedures to restore operational integrity:
   - Retrieving and analyzing forensic evidence of the incident
   - Restoring affected systems to verified secure states
   - Implementing comprehensive system hardening and security patching
   - Executing backup or snapshot restoration from clean, verified sources
   - Deploying enhanced security controls to prevent similar future incidents

5. **Ongoing Communication:** Throughout the incident lifecycle, our security team will provide transparent, timely updates to all stakeholders:
   - Regular status updates at predetermined intervals
   - Clear explanation of remediation progress
   - Realistic timelines for full service restoration
   - Guidance on any required actions for affected parties

6. **Post-Incident Analysis:** Following resolution, our security team will conduct a thorough post-mortem review to:
   - Document the complete incident timeline
   - Identify root causes and contributing factors
   - Develop specific recommendations for security improvements
   - Create a detailed incident report for leadership review

7. **Continuous Improvement & Compliance:** Nexirift commits to:
   - Implementing all identified security enhancements from post-incident analysis
   - Updating security protocols based on lessons learned
   - Conducting additional staff training where needed
   - Ensuring full compliance with all applicable data protection laws, regulations, and industry standards
   - Regular testing of our incident response capabilities through simulated exercises
