# Instance Variation

This badge indicates that a specific feature or functionality may vary between different instances of Nexirift.

<BadgeWrapper selected="Instance Variation" link={false} as="span" />

## Why?

While similar to the [Specific to Nexirift](/badges/specific-to-nexirift) badge, the Instance Variation badge serves a distinct purpose. It signifies that a particular feature might be present in some Nexirift instances but absent in others, depending on the instance configuration.

For example, an instance administrator may choose to disable the [Verification](/features/verification) feature entirely or modify specific components of it, such as the business verified checkmark option.

It's important to note that while Nexirift is designed to be highly customizable with numerous toggleable features, this badge is reserved specifically for marking sub-features rather than core features themselves. This distinction helps users understand which elements might vary depending on the specific Nexirift implementation they're using.
