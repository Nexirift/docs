# DMCA Takedown

*Disclaimer: This article references GitHub's public DMCA takedown policy for structure and clarity. We are not affiliated with GitHub. This page is for informational purposes and does not constitute legal advice.*

Nexirift is a social media platform for sharing creative work worldwide. We respect creators' rights and follow the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) to address infringement claims quickly, consistently, and fairly.

## What is the DMCA?

Enacted in 1998, the DMCA created a balanced framework that:
- Grants online service providers a "safe harbor" from monetary liability for user-uploaded content, if they respond properly to valid notices.
- Establishes a standardized notice-and-takedown process.
- Prohibits circumvention of technological measures (e.g., DRM) used to protect copyrighted works.

Without these safe harbor protections, modern platforms hosting user-generated content would face prohibitive legal risk.

## Our Commitment to Transparency

We publish redacted copies of processed DMCA notices under the @DMCA account. Personal data, confidential business information, and nonessential details are removed. This approach:
- Educates the community about copyright enforcement actions
- Deters abuse of the process
- Protects user privacy

## DMCA Request Processing Protocol

When we receive a DMCA takedown notice, we follow this workflow:

1. **Ownership & Authority Verification**
   - Confirm the claimant’s identity and authority
   - Validate domains/email headers where relevant
   - When needed, contact the purported rights holder directly
2. **Acknowledgment**
   - Send a receipt confirmation with a reference number and expected timeline
3. **User Notification**
   - Inform the uploader of the specific allegedly infringing material (URLs / identifiers)
   - Provide up to 24 hours (1 business day) to: (a) revise, (b) remove, or (c) file a counter-notice
4. **Content Action**
   - Remove or restrict access if no satisfactory response is received within the window
   - Preserve evidentiary snapshots (metadata, timestamps, hashes) for compliance
5. **Resolution & Record**
   - Notify both parties of the action taken
   - Apply our repeat infringer policy (progressive warnings → restrictions → possible termination)

## If Your Content Was Removed in Error

You may submit a counter-notice if:
- You hold a valid license or permission
- You believe the material is your original work
- The material qualifies under an applicable exception (e.g., fair use)
- The takedown resulted from misidentification

For fastest handling, submit within 1 business day of notification (later submissions are still accepted). Your counter-notice must include:

- Clear explanation of why the removal was mistaken
- Evidence of rights (license, original files, contracts, timestamped creation records, fair use rationale)
- Accurate contact information
- A sworn statement (under penalty of perjury) of good-faith belief in error

### Counter-Notice Template

Removed content (URLs or identifiers):

Reason the removal was erroneous:
[Specific, factual explanation]

Send to: [dmca@nexirift.com](mailto:dmca@nexirift.com)

After we receive a valid counter-notice, we will:
1. Forward it to the original complainant (within 24 hours)
2. Keep the content offline during the statutory waiting period
3. Restore the content unless we receive notice of legal action within 10–14 business days

Your content will be restored if:
- The complainant withdraws
- No lawsuit notice is received in time
- You provide conclusive proof of ownership
- We determine the original claim was fraudulent or abusive

If you resolve the dispute independently, ask the complainant to email us a withdrawal to accelerate restoration.
