# Vortex

Vortex is our comprehensive violation management system that handles warnings and suspensions across our platform. This framework may also be referred to as the punishment, violation, warning, or suspension system.

## How does the Vortex system work?

Vortex operates on a severity-based model to maintain community standards. Each account has a maximum threshold of 100 total severity points, with no restriction on the number of individual violations that can be recorded. Violations expire automatically over time, with expiration periods proportional to their severity level. When an account accumulates 100 or more severity points, it triggers an automatic suspension.

## How can I dispute a warning?

To dispute a warning you believe was issued incorrectly:

1. Navigate to the violations page in your account settings
2. Click/tap the "Dispute" button next to the relevant violation
3. Provide a clear, detailed explanation of why you believe the violation was incorrect or unfair

Our moderation team will review your case and take one of the following actions:

- If we determine the violation was incorrectly issued, we will remove it completely
- If we confirm the violation was justified, it will remain on your record
  - In this case, the violation will still expire normally if your account remains below the 100 severity threshold

Your complete violation history remains visible in your account, but successfully disputed violations will be clearly marked with a "Disputed" badge.

## Reporting Guidelines

We take our reporting system seriously to maintain its integrity. Users who submit multiple false or malicious reports against other accounts may themselves receive Vortex points (10 severity points per incident) for abuse of the reporting system.
