# Age Verification

<BadgeWrapper selected="Instance Variation" />

The Australian government has recently expedited and passed previously announced age verification laws. These regulations now mandate that social media platforms, including Nexirift and its instances, verify users' ages before granting service access.

## Safety

The Nexirift team remains dedicated to ensuring a safe environment for all users. However, to maintain service availability in Australia, we must comply with these new regulations or risk legal consequences that could prevent our operation within the country. Compliance may require users to provide identification documents to Nexirift instances.

## Toggling

We recognize that some instance owners may prefer not to enable this feature (a sentiment we share). You can easily disable or enable age verification by modifying the `features.age_verification.enabled` value in your instance's configuration file.

## Concerns About Implementation

The Australian government has yet to provide comprehensive guidelines for implementing these regulations. Critical questions remain unanswered: What identification documents will users need to submit? Who will safeguard this sensitive dataâ€”the government, websites, or third-party organizations?

Regardless of who manages this information, these regulations pose significant risks to user privacy and digital security by requiring personal identification. This requirement effectively eliminates online anonymity, allowing websites and organizations to identify users directly.

If such verification becomes mandatory, the verification process should logically be government-managed rather than delegated to businesses, which could lead to potential data breaches and privacy violations. A more privacy-conscious alternative would utilize app stores for age verification instead of requiring individual services to collect identification, thereby preventing unnecessary user tracking.

In our assessment, these regulations raise substantial privacy and security concerns that warrant careful reconsideration.
