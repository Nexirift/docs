# DMCA Takedown

*Disclaimer: This article has used GitHub's DMCA takedown policy as a reference. We are not affiliated with GitHub in any way.*

Nexirift is a social media platform that enables users to share creative content with a global community. We respect intellectual property rights and comply with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) to address copyright infringement claims promptly and fairly.

## What is the DMCA?

To understand the DMCA's significance, it helps to consider the digital landscape before its enactment in 1998.

The DMCA provides critical safe harbor protections for service providers hosting user-generated content. Copyright infringement claims can carry statutory damages of up to $150,000 per work, creating potentially devastating liability for platforms. Without the DMCA's protections, today's popular platforms like YouTube, Facebook, or GitHub would face prohibitive legal risks that might have prevented their development or forced them to pass significant costs to users.

The DMCA resolves this challenge by establishing a copyright liability safe harbor for internet service providers hosting potentially infringing user content. By following the DMCA's structured notice-and-takedown procedures, service providers can avoid liability for copyright infringement stemming from user-generated content.

Additionally, the DMCA prohibits circumventing technological measures designed to protect copyrighted works.

## Our Commitment to Transparency

As part of our dedication to transparency, we publish redacted versions of all processed DMCA takedown notices on our platform under the @DMCA account. These public records include all pertinent information while carefully protecting personal details and confidential information of all parties involved. This practice enables our community to understand copyright enforcement actions on Nexirift while maintaining appropriate privacy standards.

## DMCA Request Processing Protocol

When we receive a DMCA takedown request, Nexirift follows this comprehensive process:

1. **Thorough Ownership Verification:** We meticulously authenticate copyright ownership claims using multiple verification techniques, including:
   - Confirming the claimant's legitimate association with the copyright holder
   - Validating email authenticity through technical header analysis
   - When necessary, directly contacting registered copyright owners to confirm authorization

2. **Formal Acknowledgment:** Upon successful verification, we immediately send a confirmation email to the claimant acknowledging receipt of their valid request and outlining our remediation timeline.

3. **User Notification:** We provide the affected user with a detailed explanation of the copyright claim, including specific content in question. Users receive a reasonable opportunity (typically 24 hours) to either:
   - Modify their content to remove infringing elements
   - Remove the content entirely
   - Submit a counter-notice if they believe the takedown was filed in error

4. **Appropriate Enforcement:** If the user fails to respond or take necessary action within one (1) business day, we will remove the infringing content in accordance with DMCA requirements. We preserve evidence of the content for legal compliance purposes.

5. **Resolution Communication:** We provide comprehensive notification to both the copyright owner and affected user about the resolution, including specific actions taken. For repeat infringers, we implement a graduated response system that may include warnings, temporary restrictions, or in severe cases, account termination in accordance with our repeat infringer policy.

## What do I do if my content was wrongfully removed?

If you believe your content was wrongfully removed through a DMCA takedown (for example, if you have permission to use the material or believe your use constitutes fair use), you may submit a formal counter-notice to our DMCA team. We strongly recommend submitting your counter-notice within one (1) business day of receiving the takedown notification for optimal processing.

While we accept counter-notices submitted after this timeframe, prompt submission substantially increases the likelihood of swift content restoration. Your counter-notice must include:

- A detailed explanation of why the takedown was erroneous
- Compelling evidence of your right to use the content (licenses, permissions, fair use justification, etc.)
- Complete and accurate contact information
- A legally binding statement under penalty of perjury that you have a good-faith belief the material was removed due to mistake or misidentification

Submit your counter-notice directly to [dmca@nexirift.com](mailto:dmca@nexirift.com).

Upon receiving a valid counter-notice, we will:

1. Forward it to the original complainant within 24 hours
2. Notify them of the counter-claim and our legal obligations
3. Maintain temporary removal of the disputed content

Per DMCA regulations, the copyright owner has 10-14 business days to provide evidence they have initiated legal proceedings against you regarding the disputed content. During this statutory waiting period, your content remains temporarily unavailable.

Your content will be automatically restored if:
- The copyright owner explicitly withdraws their complaint
- We determine the original DMCA notice was fraudulent or filed in bad faith
- You provide conclusive evidence proving your rightful ownership
- The copyright owner fails to pursue legal action within the required timeframe

If you successfully resolve the dispute directly with the copyright owner, request they send written confirmation of the resolution to expedite restoration. We will promptly remove any DMCA-related restrictions from your account upon resolution in your favor.
