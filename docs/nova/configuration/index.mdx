# Configuration

There are two configuration files for Nova:

- [`config.json`](/nova/configuration/config.json): This is for non-sensitive configuration relating to the server, such as the character limits of posts.
- [`.env`](/nova/configuration/environment-variables): This is for **sensitive** configuration, such as the database connection string or the secret key for Stripe.
