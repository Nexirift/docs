# Our Charitable Commitment

As part of our core values, Nexirift pledges to donate a significant portion of our profits to verified charitable organizations once we achieve sustainable profitability. This commitment reflects our belief in technology as a force for positive change. Each year, we will publish a comprehensive transparency report detailing all charitable contributions, their specific allocation, and measurable impact metrics.
