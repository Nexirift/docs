# Specific to Nexirift

This badge indicates functionality exclusive to the official Nexirift platform.

<BadgeWrapper selected="Specific to Nexirift" link={false} as="span" />

## Why?

Certain documentation sections describe features that exist only in the official Nexirift implementation and are not part of the open source projects available to the public. This badge primarily appears in rules documentation, as these guidelines may differ across alternative Nexirift instances.

If you accessed this documentation from a website other than nexirift.com, be aware that the features and rules may vary for that particular instance. For clarification, please contact the administrators or developers of that specific instance. Additionally, *please inform them to update any links that direct users to this documentation page.*
