# Introduction

Welcome to the Nexirift Policy Repository. Here you will find the authoritative, most up-to-date versions of our internal policies, standards, and procedural guidelines. We publish them publicly to reinforce our commitment to transparency, accountability, and responsible governance.

Use this repository to:
- Understand the principles that guide our decisions and operations.
- Reference required practices for compliance, security, privacy, and ethical conduct.
- Identify ownership and escalation paths where noted within individual policies.

Unless a specific effective date is stated in a given document, the latest commit timestamp represents the current operative version. Policies are reviewed on a scheduled cadence and may be revised to reflect evolving regulations, industry best practices, and organizational learning.

If you have questions, suggestions for improvement, or need clarification, reach out via the contact channel indicated in each policy or submit feedback through the designated inquiry process.
