# Vortex

Vortex is our violation system, this is how we handle warnings and suspensions. This system may also be referred to as the punishment, violation, warning, or suspension system.

## Can you explain what the system is?

The system is a way to handle warnings and suspensions. An account has a limit of 100 total severity, with no limits on how many violations there are. These violations expire depending on the severity of the violation. Once an account reaches 100 total severity, it will be suspended.

## How can I dispute a warning?

<BadgeWrapper selected="Specific to Nexirift" />

You can dispute a warning by going to the violations page under your account settings, pressing/tapping the "Dispute" button and providing a valid reason on why you believe the violation was incorrect or unfair.

We will look over your violation(s) and severity and will do either of the following:

- If we believe the violation was incorrect, we will remove it.
- If the violation is justified, we will not remove it.
  - It will still expire if your account didn't reach 100 total severity.

The violation history will still be visible but any valid disputed violations will be marked with a "Disputed" badge.

## Reporting

<BadgeWrapper selected="Specific to Nexirift" />

Accounts who unjustly report other accounts multiple times may receive a Vortex point (increments of 10 severity per incident) for false reporting.
