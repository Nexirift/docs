# Specific to Nexirift

This badge is used to indicate that a feature is specific to Nexirift.

<BadgeWrapper selected="Specific to Nexirift" link={false} as="span" />

## Why?

Some sections of the documentation do not exist within the Nexirift open source projects and may not be available to the public. This badge is usually only applied to rules sections within documentation, as the rules may not apply to alternative Nexirift instances.

If you were brought here from a different website other than nexirift.com, different features and rules may apply to that specific instance. Please consult the owner(s) or developer(s) of those instances for more information _and let them know to change the links that lead here!_
