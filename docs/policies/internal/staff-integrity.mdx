# Staff Integrity

The integrity and well-being of our community members is at the heart of everything we do. We are committed to creating an environment of mutual respect, safety, and inclusion where all participants can thrive.

## Policy Update

To help uphold these core values, we are implementing a new internal policy framework. Staff members who exhibit a documented pattern of engaging in interpersonal conflicts or inappropriate conduct with community members may be subject to temporary suspension or permanent removal from their positions, based on the severity and frequency of incidents.

## Purpose and Goals

This policy framework serves to:

- Create and maintain a positive, professional environment
- Uphold the highest standards of ethical conduct
- Safeguard sensitive information and user privacy
- Ensure fair and unbiased moderation practices

## Scenario Example

To illustrate the policy application, consider this scenario:

A staff member becomes involved in a public dispute with a user on an external platform. This user is also an active member of our community where the staff member holds a position of authority.

This situation raises several critical concerns:

- Potential abuse of moderation privileges to retaliate against the user
- Risk of unauthorized access to or misuse of private user information
- Creation of a hostile or uncomfortable environment towards the user

This policy empowers senior leadership to take swift and appropriate corrective action, including temporary or permanent role adjustment, to protect community integrity and maintain professional standards.
