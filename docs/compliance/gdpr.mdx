# GDPR

The GDPR is a regulation that governs how personal data is collected, processed, and stored.

## Our Policy

<BadgeWrapper selected="Instance Variation" />

**These set of requirements are intended to provide a baseline for Nexirift instances to comply with, please seek legal advice if you have any questions.**

Based on the GDPR, we have provided a list of requirements that Nexirift instances should comply with. The list of requirements is as follows:

- Collect and store personal data in a secure manner that utilises encryption if possible.
- Provide accounts with the ability to delete, request, access, and update their personal data.

This will change depending on which instance is used. The official Nexirift site complies with the GDPR, however, other instances may not.
