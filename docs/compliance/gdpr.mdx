# GDPR

The GDPR is a regulation that governs how personal data is collected, processed, and stored.

## How do we comply?

<BadgeWrapper selected="Instance Variation" />

Nexirift instances are required to comply with the GDPR. This means that they must:

- Collect and store personal data in a secure manner
- Provide accounts with the ability to delete their personal data
- Provide accounts with the ability to request their personal data
- Provide accounts with the ability to access their personal data
- Provide accounts with the ability to update their personal data

This will change depending on which instance is used. The official Nexirift site complies with the GDPR, however, other instances may not.
