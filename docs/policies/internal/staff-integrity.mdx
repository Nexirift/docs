# Staff Integrity

The integrity and well-being of our community is crucial to us. To uphold these values and maintain a secure environment, we are implementing an important internal policy change, effective immediately. Staff members who have a pattern of involvement in drama will be removed from their position(s). This step is necessary to prevent potential conflicts and ensure the confidentiality of user information.
